#Javascript introduction

##Things I learned today:

###Literal Notation
I learned a new way to store objects in arrays and fully defining the object inside an array. Previously, I'd define the contents of an object outside of an array and then reference the object by it's name in the array. With literal notation, all object data is contained in the array.

###Multi-line Variable Concatenation
I was familiar with single-line variable concatenation using variable names, + signs and strings. I learned today there is a multi-line form of this concatenation using `+=` between the variable name and the variable's contents. This tool updates the variable at every line with the latest addition.

###What Javascript is used for (high-level view)
Javascript is used to add interactivity to websites and web applications. With HTML providing the structure to a website and CSS the presentation, Javascript creates a unique experience for the user that enables real-time information to be viewed on a website, for instance. Receiving and storing data is also a capability of Javascript, such as calculators or unit converters on the web.
